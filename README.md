This code is to keep up with time basically. 
I think with this one i was really good about not
having as many errors as I have been having. Moving forward 
I feel like I can make this code and future ones smaller and
more user friendly. 
While working on this code i of course had some hiccups. One 
In particular was getting the clocks to display together
I utilized the tutors from academic support to figure out what 
I was doing wrong or actually where i needing to fix my code.
I learned a lot from this code nothing more than the importance 
of a clean code and cleaning up my code is something I took from 
Working on this one.
